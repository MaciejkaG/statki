# statki (battleships)
The entire thing is not complete so expect vulnerabilities, missing features and more scary stuff ðŸ‘».

Simple battleships game made in Express + vanilla DHTML (seriously).<br>
It uses Redis as a store and Socket.io for websockets. All the operations like ship position validating, shot validating and rooms are made server-side.

**Unfortunately the entire repo is in Polish**, I might add localisation in the future if I feel like it.<br>
Also check out the `service-overhaul` branch that contains multiple service changes from the main branch (like accounts, e-mail auth code login, MySQL persistent match data saving and more in the future).
